# Otpless Authentication 

This project demonstrates an otpless authentication system using Java and Kotlin, designed to provide a secure and seamless login experience without the need for traditional One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

## Overview

The project utilizes a **prebuilt UI** and a **headless SDK** to facilitate otpless authentication. This approach enhances user experience by simplifying the login process and increasing security through modern authentication methods.

### Key Features

- **Prebuilt UI**: A user-friendly interface that integrates smoothly with the otpless authentication process, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.
  
- **Headless SDK**: A flexible and efficient SDK that handles authentication logic in the background, allowing for easy integration into existing applications.

- **Secure and Fast**: Eliminates the need for OTPs by using alternative authentication methods, reducing potential vulnerabilities and improving login speed.

## Technologies

- **Java**
- **Kotlin**
- **Otpless SDK**: For handling backend authentication processes.

## Getting Started

To use this project, integrate the provided prebuilt UI components and headless SDK into your application. Customize as needed to fit your app's design and workflow.
